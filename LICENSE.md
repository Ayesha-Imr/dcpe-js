### Attribution

This project includes a reimplementation of functionality from Cloaked AI by IronCore Labs.

- Original project: https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironcore-alloy
- IronCore Labs' work is based on the cryptographic scheme described in:
  _Georg Fuchsbauer, Riddhi Ghosal, Nathan Hauke, and Adam O’Neill. "Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption", ePrint Report 2021/1666._

The reimplementation in this repository was written from scratch in Python and JavaScript to provide a cross-platform, developer-friendly alternative, while respecting the original open-source intent and intellectual contribution of IronCore Labs.
